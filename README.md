The measurement of ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure on human skin represents a critical component in evaluating the risks associated with prolonged sun exposure. Chronic and excessive exposure to UV rays is directly linked to a variety of dermatological issues, including erythema (sunburn), photoaging, and more severely, an increased likelihood of skin malignancies such as melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers. This project focuses on the design and implementation of a low-cost, portable UV monitoring system using embedded hardware programmed via the Arduino IDE, aiming to support preventive dermatological care and public health awareness.

At the core of this system lies a UV sensor module interfaced with a microcontroller, typically an Arduino-compatible board, capable of real-time acquisition and analysis of ambient UV radiation levels. The device continuously monitors UV Index (UVI) values and translates them into meaningful indicators of exposure severity. Sensor calibration is achieved through comparison with standard UVI measurements, ensuring accuracy and repeatability. The system is capable of converting raw UV intensity data into actionable metrics such as recommended exposure time thresholds, categorized by skin phototypes and individual sensitivity profiles.

The Arduino IDE serves as the development environment for both sensor integration and data processing algorithms. The firmware is designed to support serial data transmission, real-time threshold warnings via onboard display or LEDs, and logging capabilities for extended monitoring sessions. Additionally, the project includes the implementation of user feedback mechanisms—such as vibration or buzzer alerts—to indicate hazardous exposure levels, thus encouraging proactive behavioral changes in outdoor environments.

Beyond the technical implementation, this project emphasizes the broader health implications of UV exposure monitoring. By equipping users with real-time awareness of environmental UV levels, the system empowers individuals to take timely protective measures such as applying sunscreen, seeking shade, or wearing UV-protective clothing. The modularity and open-source nature of the hardware and software design allow for future enhancements, including wireless data transmission to mobile devices, integration with skin health applications, or expansion to multi-sensor platforms that monitor temperature, humidity, and other environmental parameters.

In summary, this work demonstrates the feasibility and impact of developing an accessible and efficient UV exposure monitoring tool. By bridging embedded system design with public health objectives, the project contributes meaningfully to the field of wearable health technology, aiming to foster healthier habits and reduce the long-term risks of UV-induced skin disorders.
